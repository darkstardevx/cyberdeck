# 📟 CYBERDECK

### *The Ultimate Systems Intelligence Framework*

<img src="images/screenshot.png" alt="Cyberdeck Screenshot" width="800">

> **Status:** *Under Active Development* | **Language:** Rust *(2021)*
> 
> **Current Version:** **0.1.0** *(SemVer)*
> 
> **🛡️ <mark>Engineering Note</mark>: [Stack Stability]**

> **Why 2021?** Cyberdeck is anchored in a hardened, 2021-era toolchain.
> In systems-critical coding, "latest" doesn't always mean "better." While many in the industry chase the volatility of the bleeding edge, I chose to make this project as rock-solid as possible while maintaining auditability and predictable performance. By utilizing this tried and true stack, we eliminate the unnecessary churn of rapid-release cycles, ensuring that your system intelligence engine remains rock-solid and reliable under any conditions.

## ⚡ The Origin

**Cyberdeck** wasn't born in a boardroom; it was forged on **Arch Linux**, fueled by the specific, high-performance needs of a **Hyprland** workflow. I was tired of gluing together disparate, inefficient shell scripts that consumed too many resources and lacked a unified data structure.

I built this because I wanted something that felt as fast, responsive, and surgical as the environment I work in. What started as a personal utility to keep my system intelligence transparent has evolved into a full-scale framework for those who demand precision.

## 🧭 The Philosophy

This project is built for the love of the craft. My goal is to build a robust, memory-safe, and modular foundation for systems intelligence.

* **Engineering over Marketing:** This is not a commercial product. There are no trackers, no telemetry, and no hidden agendas.
* **Performance First:** Written in Rust to ensure system auditing doesn't incur the overhead common in interpreted languages.
* **Modular Architecture:** Swap, add, or customize components without reinventing the wheel.
* **AI-Friendly Output:** Designed to ingest system state and output clean, hierarchical Markdown, perfect for LLM-driven diagnostics.

## 🏗️ Installation & Deployment

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following system utilities installed:

**Debian / Ubuntu / Mint / Pop!_OS**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install lshw pciutils usbutils lm-sensors iproute2
```

**Arch Linux (pacman, yay, or paru)**

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu lshw pciutils usbutils lm_sensors iproute2
```

### Build & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/darkstardevx/cyberdeck.git
cd cyberdeck

# Run the panel (Opens @ 127.0.0.1:8080)
cargo run
```
